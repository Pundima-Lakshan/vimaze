# Vimaze

## Overview

The **Vimaze** application is a graphical tool that allows users to generate and solve mazes using different
algorithms.

## Features

- **Maze Generation** using algorithms like Prim's.
- **Maze Solving** using algorithms like BFS, and Dijkstra.
- **Configurable UI** with adjustable grid sizes, start and end positions.
- **Animation Support** for visualizing the solving process.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Pundima-Lakshan/labyrinth.git
   cd vimaze
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install customtkinter
   ```

## Usage

Run the application with:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Configuration

Modify the `solver_app_options` dictionary to customize the application's behavior, including window size, grid layout,
and UI components.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more maze generation algorithms.
- Additional visualization improvements.
- Exporting mazes as images.
- Processing mazes provided by images
